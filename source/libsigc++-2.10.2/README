libsigc++ -- The Typesafe Callback Framework for C++


General information:

   libsigc++ implements a typesafe callback system for standard C++. It
   allows you to define signals and to connect those signals to any
   callback function, either global or a member function, regardless of
   whether it is static or virtual.

   libsigc++ is used by gtkmm to wrap the GTK+ signal system. It does not
   depend on GTK+ or gtkmm.

Compatibility:

   Compatible compilers must support C++11, such as the decltype() specifier.

   All releases are tested with the gcc (g++) compiler.
   Release 2.3.2 has been tested with gcc 4.8.2, clang 3.4 and MS Visual C++ 2010.
   Release 2.5.1 has been tested with gcc 4.9.2, clang 3.6.0 and MS Visual C++ 2013.
